# Build-a-multiple-linear-regression-model-with-a-bottom-up-approach

# 1.
Define the problem and the research question: Start by defining the problem and the research question that you are trying to answer with the multiple linear regression model. For example, you might be interested in predicting the sales of a product based on several explanatory variables.

# 2. 
Collect data: Collect the data that you will use to build the model. You should have a dataset that includes the dependent variable (the one you are trying to predict, such as sales) and several independent variables (the ones that you think might be related to the dependent variable, such as price, marketing spend, etc.).

# 3.
Explore the data: Explore the data to get an idea of its distribution, relationship between the variables, outliers, missing values, etc. You can use descriptive statistics, scatter plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and other techniques to explore the data.
# Steps
# 4.
Choose a subset of variables: Based on the exploration of the data, choose a subset of variables that you think might be useful in predicting the dependent variable. Start with a small number of variables to keep the model simple.

# 5.
Fit the model: Fit a multiple linear regression model using the subset of variables that you have chosen. You can use software such as R, Python, or Excel to do this. The output of the model should include the coefficients for each independent variable, as well as the intercept.

# 6. 
Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model to see how well it fits the data. You can use measures such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, F-test, and t-tests to evaluate the model.

# 7.
Add more variables: If the model is not a good fit, or if you want to improve its accuracy, you can add more variables to the model. You can repeat steps 5 and 6 for each new set of variables that you add.

# 8.
Finalize the model: Once you have found a model that fits the data well and is accurate, finalize the model by documenting it and interpreting the results. You can use the coefficients to make predictions about the dependent variable, and you can use the model to test hypotheses about the relationships between the variables.

# 9.
Test the model: Finally, test the model on new data to see how well it performs in predicting the dependent variable. You can use measures such as mean squared error or root mean squared error to evaluate the accuracy of the model on new data.

# Remember, building a multiple linear regression model is an iterative process, and you may need to revisit earlier steps as you refine and improve the model.
